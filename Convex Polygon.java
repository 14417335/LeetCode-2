To see if a polygon is convex, calculate the angles at each of the polygonâ€™s corners. 
If all of the angles have the same sign (either positive or negative depending on the orientation), 
then the polygon is convex.

Rather than actually finding the angles, you can just find the cross product of the segments on either side of the angles. 
If the segments at point B are AB and BC, 
then the cross product has value |AB| * |BC| * Sin(theta) where theta is the angle between the two segments. 
Because the lengths are always positive, the result is positive if the angle is positive and negative if the angle is negative.

Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if this polygon is convex 
(Convex polygon definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon)

Note:
There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.
Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.
You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon (Simple polygon definition). 
In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.
